As a user, I want to see a list of plants on a web page, as well as their watering status
- Display card with plant name, watering status

As a user, I want to start and stop watering of a plant. A plant takes 10 seconds to
water.
- add button to start / stop the watering process
- assume that if a user stops a water in the middle of watering. That time is added to the next start time


The system should support watering multiple plants at the same time.
- Create database of plants that tracks watering stats

Plants need to rest from watering, so as a User, I should not be able to water the plant
again within 30 seconds of the last watering session.
- assume that once a plant is watered. It can be fully watered again after 30 seconds. 
- do not allow watering after a plant has been watered for 30 seconds

As a user, I should be visually alerted if a plant hasnâ€™t been watered for more than 6
hours.
- pop-up red warning if 6 hours has passed
